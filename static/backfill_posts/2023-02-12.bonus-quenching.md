catching the echo,
a town divided by thirst
sleeps easier.

Finally, the first drops are here.

I have spent so long waiting for the rains to come.
So many sleepless nights spent sweating in my paper-thin sheets, hoping beyond hope that even a fraction of the rain we've been promised would stop by.
Now it's here, and summer can die in peace.

The death of a season is a momentous occasion for me, but I always feel bad for summer because I'm always so happy to see it go.
The last days of brutal heat are replaced by chilling rains and I embrace it thoroughly, never stopping to say goodbye.
Six months from now I'll be freezing under a heap of blankets praying for the warmth I'm feeling right now, bu, but I'm still happy to let it all disappear today.

Well, at least I have something to write about.
Thanks for reading **Wire Haiku**, I'll see you next time.
