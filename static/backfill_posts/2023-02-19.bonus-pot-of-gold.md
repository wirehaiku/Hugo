```
rainbow lorikeets — like 
spoilt children — follow 
her jubilant trail.
dancing around them all, she relents
and scatters the grass with grain.

A pretty simple one this week.
We get plenty of [rainbow lorikeets][1] here in Brisbane; so much so that on a sunny day their presence paints every tree in town.
It's always a pleasure to see them flock about, and occasionally we get lucky enough to feed them up close.
