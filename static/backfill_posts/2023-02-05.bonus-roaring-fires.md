```
the light can burn, but
the sound is better

with covered eyes, we
turn into the crushing wind
and hear the humidity rise
```

It burns, but in a good way.

Right now, I'm doing what I always do this time of year:
obsessively tracking the weather forecasts and waiting for *The Big One*.

It's a certain day in mid-February that's so hot and humid it singes your bones and forces you to take cover.
Some years it falls on a work day and I get to take refuge inside corporate air-conditioning, other times it's on the weekend and I spend the daytime hours fleeing from one icepack to the next.

*The Big One* isn't the hottest day of the year, but it's the first one to *hurt*.
February in [Brisbane][1] is essentially one big death rattle for Summer; one last chance to rake us over the coals and make us pray for autumn.
It's honestly a highlight of the season..

If you can't already tell, it's a favourite activity of mine to personify the seasons and ascribe to them a certain character.
Autumn is a kind healer, winter is a docile sleeper, spring is a joyous party-goer and summer is an absolute beast that loves to lash out and punish us for daring to stay cool.

In a few days I'll say goodbye to summer, and in six months I'll be freezing under my blankets trying to rekindle the memories of these days. 
I can't wait.
