due high west,
a horizon made of treetops
and scattering streets.
new lights from old doors
add stars to our stars.

Welcome to **Wire Haiku's** very first patron-exclusive tanka poem!
Thank you so much for supporting my work; it truly means the world to me.

When I look out my window on a bright day, I see two things: the ocean-wrapped of my [hometown][1] to the east, and the sparsely populated [mountain range][2] to my west.
I find these mountains so interesting because of what the city has decided to build there.
Patches of dense suburbia mixed in with rickety wilderness, enormous McMansions sharing street corners with run-down old farm shacks.

Sometimes I see a bright light emanating from some random point on the mountain and I think to myself: "Who is that? What kind of person are they, and how do they feel when they look down at us? Is their view of us as romantic as our view of them?"

Again, thank you so much for supporting **Wire Haiku**, and I'll see you on Monday with the next free poem.
