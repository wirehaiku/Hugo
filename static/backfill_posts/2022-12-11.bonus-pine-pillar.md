```
now sunset
in her looming plaza,
the old men light the tree.

every stone in town
every shade of red and green.
```

I realise I start many of these posts with the phrase "I love it when", but **I love it when** someone shows me an old ritual from their own life.
Seeing all those people gather in front of an unlit tree and waiting for it to bloom, I was absolutely captured by the shared energy of it all.

All of us, sitting and waiting for someone to flip a switch and set December spinning.
