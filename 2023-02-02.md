This month, I thought I'd experiment a little by moving past visuals and instead investigating the **[sounds][1]** of the city.
Recently, a lot of my haiku have been silent, sterile presentations of something I've seen but not heard, so it felt like a good idea to shift my senses and focus on sound for this month's theme.

Also, as I write this I'm listening to [Marc Rebillet, Eryka Badhu and Reggie Watts][2] make hip hop beats out of animal sounds, and it sent my mind spinning to this particular idea.)
