leaning forward,
the brittle dandelion
waits for dawn

Welcome to the first ever post for **Wire Haiku**.
I've found myself feeling more and more like that dandelion as winter rolls through, trying to warm myself in the faint scraps of sunlight we're afforded.
Either that, or I spend half the day hunched over my tea, breathing in the steam.


Thank you for reading **Wire Haiku**, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the project.
