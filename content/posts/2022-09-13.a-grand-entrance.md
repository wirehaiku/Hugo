```
we dare to duck out
and find a bright new sun
burning out the bitters
```

For the first time in a while, I actually left my office building during lunch and went out to get sushi.
When I stepped out onto the street, I felt an actual ray of sunlight fall on my face and just stood there, basking in it.

The first moment of every season is always a delight to me, but there's something about spring that's a little bit sweeter; the way it parts the clouds and warms me so.
