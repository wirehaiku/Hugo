```
bridge in the breeze â€”
we leave the city's spring
and step out into summer
```

There are plenty of bridges in my hometown, and it's always a slight shock when you step out onto them and get hit with the pure ocean air.
There's a few beautiful minutes of salt and sweat as the breezes flows through you, then you step back onto the street and it all fades away.

I love moments like that, all the tiny little biomes we walk through in our daily lives.
