winter layers:

I imagine this haiku like folds of cardboard in a pop-up book, stacking up in front of one another to form the scene.
For me, it's a useful exercise to simply sit and note the colours in my view, the arrangement of each piece from closest to farthest.

Like layers in Photoshop, they all come together to form a bigger picture.
