pandanus beach:
barely enough sand
to sing to
```

Pandanus Beach is a local man-made beach that I grew up with and spent quite a lot of time in, so it's rich in my memories. When I was young I thought it was a massive place, but returning there now it's just a narrow little square of sand sat behind a park. 

It's funny how the world changes — and doesn't change — as you grow older.
