```
flowers in the air â€”
reflections of a garden
in a tenth-story window
```

I'm getting tired of winter and looking forward to spring, hence the rapid acceleration of greenery in my work as of late.

There's a lot of buildings with very reflective glass in my city, so occasionally I'll look up and see a flawless reflection of something just hovering in the sky.
Today it was a small garden in the centre of a park, and I spent quite a bit of time staring upward at the glass, sideways at the garden and downward at the flowers.
Quite a strange pathway, but it was worth it.
