```
unwelcome rainclouds —
I slam the kitchen window
and pretend it’s still summer
```

I always dream about summer in winter. 
When it's cold and grey, when the clouds stand still, when the chilled wind soaks into my house and into my clothes, I dream of the days where it's too hot to go outside.

Of course, in those days I dream of winter.
