```
strands of moonlight
fight my fluorescents
and win
```

The moon is its own reward.

I like to watch the rotations of the day; I like to see the world turn and the light sources change.

Sometimes I come home and the full moon is staring right into my house, flooding the space with silver beams and putting everything at ease.
In those moments, I just sit in the window and let the moonlight take over.
