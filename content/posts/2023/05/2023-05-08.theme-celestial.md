```
on the clearest nights,
we share a scope
and sail the sea of tranquility
```

Pardon the brief hiatus, but I'm back and feeling \*sparkly\*.

The last two weeks took me away from writing, but I'm back with a vengeance and in the mood for celestial creations.
Now that the skies have finally cleared up, I'm gaining a greater appreciation for astronomy and all the little things that go on above us.

During my morning run yesterday, I saw the full moon in broad daylight and felt the desire to explore every crevice I could see.
All the history that's up there, all the details and imperfections scattered across its surface; it's a thing of beauty that I'm finally beginning to appreciate.

This month is all about the beauty of the spheres and the way they shine down on us. 
I hope you enjoy it.
