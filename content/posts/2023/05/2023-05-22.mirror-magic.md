distant pinpricks make
reflections in my cellphone â€“
they are the stars!

Sometimes black mirrors are nice.

I'm a bit rushed this week, so today's post is an oldie from my archives.
Still, I like the juvenile attitude it brings, that feeling of "oh yeah, there's a whole sky up there I'm not paying attention to!"

I like being reminded of the world around me; of the world I should spent more time looking at.
