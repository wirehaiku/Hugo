a pastel sunrise crowns
our makeshift palace.

So yeah, ChatGPT scares me a little.

As someone who's (currently unmonetized) hobby is writing pretty words, it's very weird to see a computer do the same.
It's not very good at it, but it's getting better every day and I can certainly imagine a future full of computer-generated art that's on a level playing field with manmade works.

Still, that particular nightmare is a few decades away and I doubt "haiku bloggers" is the first target for AIs to disrupt. 
So I might as well keep on writing; keep on enjoying this delightful hobby as long as I can.
