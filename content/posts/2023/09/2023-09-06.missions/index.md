After my intermittent August I'm continuing with the [ancients][1] theme.
I'm honestly glad to get another month with it, since it's such an interesting tool to play with.

Music today is an ancient YouTube video that still pops up in my recommendations every now and again.
It's [*Catgroove*][2] by Parov Stelar.
