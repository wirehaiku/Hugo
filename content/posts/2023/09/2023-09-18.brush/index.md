brushing the dust
off your father's porch:
he always liked the bonfire

Traditions are what we leave behind.

I'm not much of a believer, but I do think there are ways people can live on.
Little rituals, traditions, activities that you give to others; things you do that they end up doing without you.

Today's music is ancient by YouTube standards but still lives in in my heart: [*We Might Be Dead by Tomorrow*][1] by Soko, a song about being angry at the person you fell in love with because they don't realise how urgent that love is.
