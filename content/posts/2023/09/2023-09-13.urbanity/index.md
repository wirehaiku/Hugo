a single thread of green
weaving through the grey

Turning into the sun.

It's always nice to see wilderness in the middle of so much structure, especially when it has to fight so hard just to be noticed.

Music today is a song that only has three views on YouTube (at time of writing): the acoustic version of [*Backlines*][1] by Stars.
I just can't get enough of Stars, and I can't get enough of slow, sad songs about people trying their very best to find happiness.
