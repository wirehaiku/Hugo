a shiny penny
drifting through the muck
of an old storm

First, a note.
As you can probably tell by the recent state of the [archives][1], I haven't been posting a ton lately.
Sorry about that.
It's been a busy month, but I'm happy to say I'm back at it.

Second, I love granting old age to fleeting things. The idea of an "old storm", of a raging cloud growing stronger each day instead of just withering away by morning; it's a beautiful image.
