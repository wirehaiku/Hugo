the old trees:
in this light,
i can almost see them

There's that moment during sunset when all the colours come out to play: the clouds turn pink, the mountains turn purple and everything in front of them gets a dreamlike tint.
Sometimes I'll be walking home and the sunset will backlight an entire chunk of the horizon I forgot was there.

Music today is this [fan compilation][1] of music by Parcels: chill without being cold, soft without being spineless.
Parcels is what I listen to when I need to listen to myself.
