Believe it or not, this isn't my first haiku about [goths][1].

Between old episodes of *Degrassi* and Spotify's sudden decision to drown me in sad music, I'm in a goth-y mood.
Parties in the woods always seemed like such an adventure: running through the forest void, finding strange places to hang out, seeing and doing things you shouldn't, all while you're completely alone but somehow unafraid.

Today's music is tangentially goth, but has an aggression and a meanness to it that just cuts right through me.
It's [*Retributions Of An Awful Life*][2] by Heartworms.
They're a new artist with only a handful of songs to their name, but I desperately hope they stick around and make more.
