Wipe the slate(s) clean.

Obviously I live nowhere near the Atlantic ocean, but I'm watching a ton of *Judging Amy* right now and I'm swimming in ice-cold Connecticut scenery.

Speaking of the cold, music today is [*Your Ex-Lover Is Dead*][1] by Stars, one of those bands I desperately wish I had found when they were at their peak.
Twelve years ago, I was such a hopeless romantic and I would have loved all the hopeless romance Stars had to offer.
Now I just feel guilty that I don't feel enough.
