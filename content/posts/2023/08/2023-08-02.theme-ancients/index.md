We're going back in time.

Fair warning: I've been reading *Dante's Inferno* and I'm getting a lot of *strange* inspiration.

Last month our theme was [contacts][1]: how it feels to touch and feel and inhabit the scenes we write about.
That was a good exercise and a fun challenge, but by the end I was just plain running out of things to say.
(You can tell because I was posting haiku that wasn't about the theme [at all][0].)

Hopefully — famous last words — this theme will be a little more flexible.

These ye olde texts I'm reading have put me in the mood for history; the passage of time and how it affects the world around us.
This month's theme is all about [ancients][2]: the rotten and regrown, the broken and rebuilt, the old myths and the new theories.
It's also just an excuse to have fun and write some weird haiku, and isn't that the whole point of this blog?

I can't wait to write about this stuff, and I can't wait for you to read it.
See you next time.
