Harmony in the chaos.

Sometimes you think of an image and it just sticks with you forever.
Life and death, order and chaos, fields of gravestones against fields of trees; all these pictures just
run together like paints on a palette.

Music today is [*Sea Creatures*][1] by SOAK: a song about the terrible middle-teens where you're old enough to understand tragedy but young enough to be powerless against it.
