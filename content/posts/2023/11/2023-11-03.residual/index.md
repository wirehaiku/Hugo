A sudden something in the air.

Sometimes a person just takes over the moment.
A look or a smell or a certain aura passes you by and suddenly you're in detective mode, trying to figure out what could have possibly captured your attention like that.

Today's music is certainly capturing: [*Got To Keep On*][1] by The Chemical Brothers.
I must have watched the opening twenty seconds a dozen times when I first discovered it; there's something about [Michel Gondry][2]'s videos that just possess you the moment you hit play.
