Cat on a cold brick roof.

In my city, there are an inexplicable number of skyscrapers with enormous ground-level air-conditioning vents.
Huge cross-hatched maws gushing old air out into the street, all day every day.
I don't particularly enjoy it, but I imagine it's pleasing to some.

Music today is this entirely random [deep lo-fi house mix][1] I found on YouTube, which sort of makes me feel like a wallflower at a very mellow prom.
