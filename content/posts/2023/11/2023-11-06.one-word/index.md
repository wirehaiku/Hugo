Let's try some one-word haiku:

```
saltwater
igneous
cobblestone
searchlights
akihabara
```

<!--more-->

Inspired by â€‰Cor van den Heuvel's deceptively brilliant one word haiku, which I feel I must reproduce in full, spacing and all:


<pre><code>

tundra


</code></pre>

I thought I'd take a crack at writing my own one-word haiku, but with subjects a little more complex.
My personal favourite is "cobblestone", and perhaps my least is "akihabara" (place names are just cheating).
Maybe I'll take another swing at these in the future, when I need a change of pace.

Music today is [*It Gets Funkier IV*][1] by Vulfpeck and Louis Cole.
Vulfpeck might just be my favourite instrumental act ever: usually music feels hollow without lyrics, but there's something about Vulfpeck's instrumental work that fills the void.
(Their music with lyrics is also great.)
