```
the scent of morning dew
is completely absent
from this doctor's office
```

I'm not where I should be.

For some reason, all my doctor's appointments occur extremely early on beautiful mornings.
I'll be sitting in some faded taupe waiting room, turn my head and see — through the dingy office glass — hummingbirds and butterflies dancing in the mist.

It's annoying, to say the least.

Music today is... [whatever this is][1].
I don't know, it's been a long day.
