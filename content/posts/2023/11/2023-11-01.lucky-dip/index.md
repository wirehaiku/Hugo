This month is a haiku theme lucky dip!
I've been bound to a single theme per month for [over a year now][1], and while the system's worked well I think it's nice to shake things up every once in a while.
(It's also hard to keep coming up with [incredibly abstract one-word theme ideas][2], so this month gives me some time to think of more.)

Today, I'd like you to listen to the [entire Social Network soundtrack][3].
Specifically, I'd like you to listen to it while doing something slightly stressful or intimidating: homework, masonry, systems administration; anything.
This soundtrack is like a whetstone to the mind; it just makes everything a little sharper.
