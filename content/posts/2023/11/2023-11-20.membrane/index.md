Seasons in south-east Australia are often delimited by rain: enormous, sweeping, slate-cleaning storms that soak up all the old weather and dropkick you into the new.
As I write this it's pouring rain on the late edge of November and neither me nor the Bureau of Meteorology knows what's on the other side.
Good times.

Today's music is the polar opposite of my surroundings: [*Sunshower*][1] by Taeko Ohnuki, a bright, airy 80's city pop album that makes you want to run to a rooftop coffeeshop and drink in the whole city.
