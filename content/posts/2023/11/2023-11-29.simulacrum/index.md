A view into a view.

Sometimes in haiku, you can just be literal and state the reality you see in front of you.
I also enjoy the dual-layer effect of observing a reality *inside* your reality, like stepping through a painting.
Simple, but effective.

Today's music is [*minamisenju*][1] by downt, a random song I found in a YouTube playlist that somehow became my most-listened to song this year.
I think I've been watching too much *Bocchi the Rock*.
