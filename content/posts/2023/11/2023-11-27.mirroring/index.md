Rarely do you see anime brought to life, but I caught a glimpse of it tonight.
Some enigmatic rider on a polished green-black beast, cruising through the dark streets, the street lights painting him as he passes.
It was a majestic few seconds.

Music today is [this scene][1] from *10 Things I Hate About You*.
Don't ask me why, it just is.
