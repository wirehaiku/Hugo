Well, this is embarrassing. 

<!--more-->

Poetry is supposed to be fun for me, but the decisions I made last month were a little too monetize-y and kinda ruined the whole vibe.
So, I'm making two major changes:

1. No more Patreon page. I lost interest in it almost immediately and most of the bonus content I produced wasn't worth the price.

2. We're going back to three posts a week. Even though the weekly digest format is a little better for productivity, it's a lot worse for my mental health. The whole blog just became a [sword of Damocles][1] hanging over my head.

**tldr:** I'm back to basics and not-for-profit. 
Please stand by as I restore the chill vibes this whole thing was supposed to produce in the first place.
