```
a thousand cicadas
replaced by a single squawk â€”
changing of the guard
```

Sometimes you get to see the world change.

At some point in my morning run, I turned a corner and realised the day had completely turned.
No longer was I carefully making my way through tight grey fog amidst the sounds of insects, I was instead sprinting through clear daylight and listening to the birds.

I love moments like that; moments where the whole world turns on a dime right in front of you.
Moments that make the world feel like a *world* and not just a blank canvas.
