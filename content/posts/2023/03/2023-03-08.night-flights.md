Bats: nature's fade to black.

So we have [quite a lot of bats][1] in my hometown, and they're always a sight to behold.
They fly slower and lower than most of our birds, so if you're in the right place you can get pretty close.

Whenever they fly overhead, there's always a shared moment where everyone on the street just stops to admire them; the beauty of these strange creatures pouring across the sky.
(Moments like that are why I live in cities to begin with.)
