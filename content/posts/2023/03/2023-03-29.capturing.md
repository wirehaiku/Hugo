I'm always fascinated by what spaces animals choose to make for themselves.
What they choose to play with, where they choose to go; the micro and macro patterns that appear across their generations.

Maybe that milkcrate just got there, or maybe it's been there for decades; but in that moment it wasn't just a milkcrate, it was the walls of a world they made for themselves.
