behind plexiglass,
the courtyard oak
sheds its last wild leaf

Run wild, even in captivity.

Not a lot of deciduous trees in eastern Australia, but a man can dream.
A few days ago I saw a beautiful tree sitting in a glass cage in some lobby, going through the motions of life as some hyper-rich nutrient sludge gets pushed through its veins.
It was a weird moment.

I don't know how to feel about sights like that; whether it's good to capture a living thing and treat it like royalty, or if no amount of good treatment can make up for a prison sentence. 
I suppose it's a case-by-case basis.
