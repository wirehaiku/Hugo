```
yellowing branches
wet with unseen rain â€”
autumn's first breath

It's here.

Finally, summer is on its last legs and autumn is beginning to bloom.
I love all the seasons equally, but more than that I love the transitions *between* the seasons.
It's always such a thrill to wake up and feel a change in the air.
