```
after the rains,
a tree frog navigates
his now horizontal home.
```

Autumn brings rain, and rain brings mess.

It's finally raining again!
After a dry January and scorching February, the Australian sky is finally starting to open up a little and give us what we need.
But as always, the rain makes things a little messier.

This haiku was inspired by a high-school memory of me walking home and finding a massive tree laying across the main road where I lived, and watching all the little critters that lived inside it find new places to go.
