```
light, darkness, ocean, storms —
we stand on the bow
and pierce the world itself

Originally this haiku was just a collection of layer words by themselves (e.g.: "sun · fog · ocean · storms") but I felt the need to give it a little context.

Also, as a teenager who legitimately listened to Titanic's soundtrack every night, I just love working with this kind of scenery.
