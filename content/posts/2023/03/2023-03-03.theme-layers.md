```
leaves over lattice —
pockets of perfect shade
shatter in the wind

Peeling back the layers of the world.

I was digging through my poetry archives earlier this week and found — as one does — a forgotten obsession.
There was a moment years back where I apparently became fixated on *layers*: building haiku with a sense of depth and object complexity to them.

It seems like a fun idea, so why not do it again?
This month I'll be writing with a z-axis and trying my best to build dense, interwoven scenes.
Wish me luck!
