```
after sunset,
before the streetlights turn on â€”
the misty darkness
```

Sometimes the night is just for you.

I've starting running again, this time in the weird little pockets of time that aren't quite day or night.
In doing so, I've noticed that there's a beauty to the transitional moments; a liminal peace that you can only find in man-made nature.

"Streetlight time" is a such a great time to be outside.
You get to see the world change right in front of you: stores open and close, people come and go, animals wake and sleep.
It's the perfect time to be alive.
