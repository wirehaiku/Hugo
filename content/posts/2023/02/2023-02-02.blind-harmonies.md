and all the barking stops

Hello cacophony, my old friend.

This month, I thought I'd experiment a little by moving past visuals and instead investigating the **[sounds][1]** of the city.
Recently, a lot of my haiku have been silent, sterile presentations of things seen but not heard, so it felt like a good idea to shift my senses and focus on the opposite for this month's theme.

(Also, as I write this I'm listening to [Marc Rebillet, Eryka Badhu and Reggie Watts][2] make hip hop beats out of animal sounds, and it sent my mind spinning to this particular idea.)

```
battling thunderstorms â€”
from inside, i only hear 
the echoes
```

To get specific, there are two main kinds of sound I'd like to spend this month writing about: the sounds we *don't* hear, and the sounds we *forget* to hear.
Like the way chirping crickets fading into the background, or how walking into a house erases the sounds of the place you just escaped.

```
crickets
...
a louder silence
```

Sound is such a fun tool to play with and I'm surprised it took me this long to get my act together and play with it.
Thanks for reading **Wire Haiku**, and thank you for sticking with me as I change to this new format.
