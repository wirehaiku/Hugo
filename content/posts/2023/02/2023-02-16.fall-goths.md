```
bela lugosi's dead —
a rusty old jukebox
in a black-haired beer garden
```

So yeah, I've been watching a lot of [Strange Aeons][1].

Last week I wrote about [nightlife][2], and I'm still kinda perusing that subject. 
Maybe it's all the [True Blood][3] clips I've been watching, maybe it's all the [Bauhaus][4] I've been listening to, but I'm in a dark and stormy mood right now.

```
the clinking chains,
the slowly-snapping fishnets —
mating dance
```

Specifically, my mind keeps coming back to this central idea of a goth club street at midnight. 
All the [sounds][5] that could fill such a place; all the people and places and music and howling and vaguely vampiric goings on that could fill a street like that.
Crowds of people with raven tattoos and chain-link leggings all falling into each other.

```
two wishful goths
coax a curious raven
to their table
```

And somewhere in a quiet corner nobody pays attention to, an actual raven swoops down to snatch a morsel off the ground, not knowing it's putting on a show for all the spooky kids heading home.
