```
the buzz of bad neon,
the clanging, the rattling
of good moths
```

Let's sweat outside, for once.

I'm currently shut indoors listening to [math rock][1], but I'm reminiscing about those pre-COVID times when you could just wander outside *whenever you wanted*. 
The heady days that my nostalgia-addled brain says were better than the ones we're in now, when crowded streets were something you would leap into with glee.
I'm sure we'll get back there eventually, but the memories will do for now.

```
a guitar gently weeps
in the fourth reflection
of a tavern's echo
```

Specifically it's the music I'm reminiscing most about.
Personally I think live music sounds best from at least two blocks away, when the imperfections disappear and you finally hear what the artist is trying to say.
When you're not quite sure what genre it is or even where it's coming from, but you're sure it's something you want to hear.

(Also, this may be the most artsy-fartsy haiku I've ever written.)

```
of course,
from her balcony
it all sounds better
```

And then the night ends, with you — and hopefully someone who likes you — staring out at the screaming crowds you just exited and deciding it was worth it.

Goodnight, and thank you for reading **Wire Haiku**.
I'll see you next week.
