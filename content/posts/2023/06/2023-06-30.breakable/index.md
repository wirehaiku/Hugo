shattered stonework
and the slowly melting hail
run together in the street

I'm in an edgy mood today.

After listening to far too much [Pale Waves][1] (which somehow still feels like not enough), I'm feeling a little cloudy and in the mood for broken imagery. 
You don't really see a lot of ruins in a modern city, but occasionally a calamity will come knocking and the streets will be filled with all kinds of thematically-relevant rubble.

If you're looking for music with some emotional rubble, I'd heartily recommend the aforementioned Pale Waves or literally anything by [girl in red][2], who seems to be going through all the stages of grief at hyperspeed.
