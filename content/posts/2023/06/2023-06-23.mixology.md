```
midnight on main street:
arterial rainwater
and the smell of cheap wine
```

We're drowning in each other.

Midnight in the city is a dazzling sight: people wandering in and out of various establishments, folks holding court on street corners and entire crowds weaving in and out of each other.
Each nightclub is its own little fiefdom, clashing and colliding with its neighbours.

As for music, right now I'm deep in a [drum and bass][1] rabbit hole, which is usually what happens when I have too much work and not enough time to do it in.
See you Monday.
