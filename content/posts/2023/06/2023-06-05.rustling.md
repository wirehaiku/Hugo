falling leaves brush
my shoulder - those newborn gulls
are at it again

Spring is a time for troublemaking.

I like to watch birds, which means I like to watch trees.
Swaying, shaking, rustling; there's a little symphony of activity in each one.

Tonight I'm listening to [映画の中の出来事][1] by Atlantis Airport, which — despite the fact that I can't understand a single word — might just be the best song I've ever heard.
