```
low-flying fog 
marbles with the night â€” 
freezing, freeing all
```

If you can't tell already, I *really* like fog.

Another day, another fog haiku. 
Sorry, but fog might just be the element of nature I feel closest to.
It's my spirit animal, my inner light, and my absolute obsession during the winter months.

Searching my Spotify library for "fog", my only hit is *[In The Fog, In The Flame][1]* by Bec Sandrige, a song I don't remember downloading but that sounds *exactly* like the moody mindbenders I would have been listening to in 2017.
Past Me is a predictable fellow.
