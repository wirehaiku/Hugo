```
downwind of winter:
we shudder, and shelter,
and make ourselves scarce
```

It's time to feel something.

So last month was all about the [celestial][1] theme: suns and moons and the music of the spheres.
It was fun, but by the end it was running a little thin and I was struggling to find ways to shoehorn sunlight into everything I wrote.

This month is a little more abstract, and — hopefully — a little more freeing.
This month we're working with the idea of **sensation**: the idea that *feeling* nature is just as important as seeing or hearing it.
To me a haiku is a textual snapshot of a moment in time, and the physical sensations of that moment are import details worth including.

Also, to share in this theme of *feeling*, I thought I'd restart the practice of sharing what I'm listening to as I'm writing.
Today it's the newly released *[NO INTENTION][2]* by SBTRKT and LEILAH, which to me feels like the thematic mirror to Drake's *[Feel No Ways][3]*.
I first discovered SBTRKT about ten years ago in a [random YouTube video][4], but they're always a dream to listen to.
