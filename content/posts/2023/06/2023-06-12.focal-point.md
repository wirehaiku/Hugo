```
bonfire night â€”
we set fire to the beaches
and trap summer in a circle
```

A memorial to the other season.

Sometimes you need to remind yourself what comes after winter; whether that's starting a fire or bathing in a lone scrap of sunlight. 
Even in Australia it gets cold enough to miss the heat.

Speaking of fire, *[Fire for You][1]* by Cannons has been on my Spotify's rotation for months.
I have a strange addiction to sad songs that still slap and this is no exception.
