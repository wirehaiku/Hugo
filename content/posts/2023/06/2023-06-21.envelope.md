in twilight fog,
the pale moon becomes
our only star.

Grey skies aren't all bad.

I absolutely adore fog.
Waking up to it, falling asleep to it, watching it swallow the world and then slowly let us go; it's a sight to see.

Tonight I'm perusing an old blog where I used to talk about indie music and I found *[South][1]* by Sumner, which somehow sounds more Australian to me than [Men at Work][2] and [Ganggajang][3] put together.
There's something free-floating about it, something that makes you want to cast off your bonds and roam the wilderness until you find a reason to live.
