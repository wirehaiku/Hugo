ampitheatre — 
moonlit, empty, alone; we dance
across the frozen stage
```

Who needs the limelight when you've got moonlight?

So I've been watching (and rewatching) a lot of the *[Before][1]* trilogy: the Linklater films that showcase a single relationship across decades of space and time. 
In this particular viewing I find myself paying more attention to the scenery than the actors, the coffeeshops and alleyways and staircases our protagonists occupy.

I know [Paris syndrome][2] is real and idolising the city is just setting myself up for failure, but I find the nooks and crannies of Paris — as presented in these films — to be fascinating.
There's sense of combined youth and age: rotting cobblestones teeming with newborn flowers, a hundred-year-old cafe with Wi-Fi and fresh glass in the windows.

Today I'm listening to [My Analog Journal][3], an amazing compendium of vinyl music from all around the world. No matter what mood I'm in, MAJ always has something good to listen to.
