church bells ring

This particular haiku has been bouncing around in my brain for the better part of a decade.
It might be braindead simple and barely even a haiku, but something about it just *works* for me;
something about this incredibly obvious observation rings true in a way my more complex attempts at poetry don't,

Today I'm listening to *[Calypso Beach][1]* by Northeast Party House, which feels like the musical mirror to this haiku.
Simple, straightforward, but with a piercing resonance I can't quite leave alone.
