the old magpie
builds one last nest
right in front of everybody

I suppose it's not *technically* a haiku about **[brightness][1]**, but I do think one important aspect of summer is seeing all the effects of spring.
Yes, there are plenty of newborn creatures to see, but I also enjoy seeing the old guard finally come out to play after putting in so much work.
