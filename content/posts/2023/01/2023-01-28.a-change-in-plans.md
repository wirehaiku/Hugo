Short version: big weekly posts instead of little daily ones.

<!--more-->

So I've been doing this blog for about six months now, and the largest trend I've noticed is that my desire to write — and to *rewrite* — varies wildly from day to day.
This is a normal experience for most people, but it's particularly damaging to this blog.

Because I'm writing individual poems every other day, the quality isn't very consistent.
Sometimes you get a good, well-edited, spell-checked post; sometimes you get a messy stream-of-conciousness dump that barely makes sense.
And sometimes you don't get any posts at all!
Boy, September was *rough*.

Clearly, things need to change.
I need a new schedule that smooths out the rough patches in my productivity.
I need time to to *edit*, and to ensure that I'm writing at a consistent level of quality.
(And I also need time to just zone out and not write anything, if that's my mood on the day.)

So, here's the new schedule:

- One free post every Thursday, featuring three haiku.
- One Patreon-exclusive post every Sunday, featuring one tanka.

This is the exact same amount of content I was producing before, just bundled to better suit my mental capacity and the free time I have available.
Thank you for your patience, and thank you for reading **Wire Haiku**.

(To think, when I started this blog I wanted to post *daily*. Ugh.)
