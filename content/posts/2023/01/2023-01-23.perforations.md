I love seeing the evolution of spider architecture every summer.
At first, they're building webs everywhere: front doors, kitchen windows, mailboxes; wherever they can hang a thread.
But eventually, they catch wise and find better places to build, places that stand the test of time.

It always feels good to see an old spiderweb still maintained by its owner, still firmly rooted to whatever clever little place the spider found for it.
