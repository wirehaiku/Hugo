sea winds strafe
into the urban canyon

It's always a nice feeling when you turn a corner in a coastal city and walk right into a tight pocket of cool ocean air.
There are some parts of town close to the shore that perfectly ensnare these winds and make the whole block feel like another place entirely.

(Of course there are also parts of town that escape these forces and become their own little hellholes, and the two parts are often intertwined.)
