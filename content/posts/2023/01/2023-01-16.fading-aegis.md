```
sunburnt herons
chase the last remaining cloud,
desperate for shade

Two things:

1. Yes, I did just learn what the word *aegis* means, thank you very much.

2. I often wonder how different animals feel about the summer sun; whether birds dislike the brutal noon rays and stop to find shade, or if they enjoy bathing in it and riding the white-hot winds to their destination.
