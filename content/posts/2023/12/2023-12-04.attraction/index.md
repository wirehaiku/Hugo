Somewhere a feathered head is turning.

Growing up in suburban Brisbane, [rainbow lorikeets][1] were an ever-present delight.
Given the slightest invitation, they'd crowd all the nearby roofs and fences and sing en masse until you fed them.
And yes, they can always smell what you're cooking.

Today's music is an old band from Brisbane that debuted when I was in high school, but still lingers in our collective memory: [*My Happiness*][1] by Powderfinger.
