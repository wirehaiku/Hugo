```
midnight on the eve,
one look back at the Christmas party
and I vanish.
```

See you next year!

Well, that's it for 2023.
I wrote [a lot of haiku][1], said a lot of things and linked to a lot of music that makes me feel old; but somehow it never feels like enough.
Thank you so much for reading **Wire Haiku**, it's been a pleasure doing all of this for you.

Have a happy and safe Christmas, try not to make too many New Year's resolutions and I'll see you next year on Monday January 8th 2024.
Goodbye!
