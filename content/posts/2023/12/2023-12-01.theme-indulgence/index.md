shielding our coffee
from the rain, sipping quickly
beneath our coats
```

It's time to feel better.

I'm going on a little hiatus from December 16[^1], but these first two weeks are all about Christmas comforts and indulging in the seasonal glee.
These haiku will be a healthy mix of Australian summer sun and fantasy winter wonders, but it'll all focus on the minutia of happy human indulgence.

You cannot escape from [today's music][1].
