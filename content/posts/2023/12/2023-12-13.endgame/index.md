```
with a whimper,
our blankets vanish
in summer's final stage.
```

Cast the covers off.

As any reader of this blog knows, I love to talk about the staging of the seasons.
The last gasp of winter, the first kiss of spring, etcetera, etcetera.
I'm obsessed with the planet's patterns.

There's always a moment in summer when the heat truly hits: when the last scraps of winter are truly erased.
No more blankets, no more jackets, no more boiling hot coffee searing our insides.
No more.

Ironically, today's music is [*Sweater Weather*][1] by The Neighbourhood: a song about a climate that simply does not exist in Australia, but that I endlessly enjoy fantasising about.
