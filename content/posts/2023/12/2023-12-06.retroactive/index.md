```
in the moonlight
beneath the white plastic tree
i can almost remember winter
```

A whisper of wonder.

It gets very hot in Australia, as you'd expect.
But sometimes, even in the very depths of summer, you can catch a glimpse of winter and remember what it's like to be cold; to remember the days when you worried about the weather and dared to wear more than one layer at a time.

For reasons I can't fully explain, I'm once again listening to the ancient pop music of my youth.
Today's music is [*All I Have*][1] by J-Lo.
