Some poems are deathly simple.
I remember a forest fire near my home when I was a child, and the whole debacle was preceded by a cloud of birds flying away in all directions.
Eventually they came back, but I'll always remember them more than I remember the actual fire.

For today's music, I'm in the mood for ancient things.
I've been listening to old YouTube music, back when YouTube was just the weird little website where people would sit in front of their webcams and bare their souls for a dozen views.
[*Fireflies of Montreal*][1] by Laurena Segura is what I think of when I think of that moment in time
