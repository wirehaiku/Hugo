I have a lifelong fantasy of throwing an entire loaf of bread into a flock of pigeons.
I'm sure it wouldn't be good for them, but the pure image of a feathered feeding frenzy makes me giddy.

Music today is the piano bar classic [*Closing Time*][1] by Semisonic.
After years of streaming music from Spotify I'm back to buying MP3s, and the first thing I picked up was Semi's entire discography.
Check out the [Todd episode][2] if you're hungry for more.
