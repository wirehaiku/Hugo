in the whipping wind,
a bright young bird swoops me:
it must be spring.
```

It starts before it starts.

This month's theme is the polar opposite of the [last][1].
Whereas last month was all about the prior and pre-existent, this month is about the creation and discovery of brand new things.
Fortunately it's spring, which means novelty and new things abound.

Speaking of new things (sort of), today's song is [*Someone New*][2] by Hozier.
I've been revisiting his work and I forgot just how new he felt when he came on the scene back in 2013.
Every few years there's a musician who pushes through the old noise and gives you a brand new sensation; a feeling that tomorrow will be an entirely different day.
