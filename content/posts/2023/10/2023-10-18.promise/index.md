the smell of rain
a moment before
the sight of it

Wait for it.

Summer quickly approaches in the southern hemisphere, and one of my favourite things about it is the constant, unyielding rain.
The smell of oncoming rain is such a delight I actually crave it, to the point that I can't help but rush to the window when I hear the first drops.

Music today is not the [obvious choice][1], but something a little weirder: [*Rainbows in the Dark*][2] by Tilly and the Wall.
I really miss that frantic 2000s folk music vibe: the nervous energy, the nonsense lyrics, the desperate desire to have fun when the world doesn't really want you to.
Rainbows in the Dark came out when I was 20 years old, and it was the first song I really felt *connected* to; the first song I felt was truly mine.
Maybe it can be yours, too.
