```
flashlights in the rain â€”
every second, a thousand drops
make their way to us
```

Paint the town white.

Okay fine, this haiku was *slightly* inspired by [the scene in Jurassic Park][1] where the kids almost get eaten by the T-Rex.
But you have to admit, raindrops and flashlights look pretty great together.

I just spent all day setting up a [Navidrome][2] server and uploading all my old MP3s, so today's music is one of the first songs I ever bought with my own money: 2006's [*Let's Make Love and Listen to Death From Above*][3] by CSS.
Still an absolute banger.
