I'm running a little experiment this week.

<!--more-->

For the month of October, I'll be experimenting with a newsletter format for Wire Haiku.
It'll be the same content as always (three haiku a week), just delivered in one big post instead of three small ones.

Bundling my work up like this should help smooth out my intermittent attention span and give me more time to do things right.
Plus, if it works I can start sending the posts out as email, since that seems to be the trend nowadays.

The first newsletter should be out on Sunday. See you then.
