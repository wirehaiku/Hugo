This haiku is from my ancient archives, but it's a rare one I actually like.
Sometimes adding one tiny detail to a haiku is all you need to bring it into focus.
I don't even know if there's a Baker Street in my hometown, but I can already imagine what it must look like.

Music today is [another banger set][1] from [Book Club Radio][2].
Seriously, I can (and often do) listen to their stuff for days on end, specifically [Tinzo][3]'s burning-bright jazz mixes.
