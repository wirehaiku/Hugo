I had the pleasure of seeing [Barbie][1], which was quickly marred by the displeasure of walking home in the pitch black winter evening.
It's only a short walk from the train station to my house, but the streetlights thin out rapidly and the last few steps are oddly spooky, despite the fact that I'm so close to home.

Music today is another banger compilation from [Flavour Trip][2], who seem to be the world's best DJs for tired nerds who need to get things done.
It's the perfect music to stress out to.
