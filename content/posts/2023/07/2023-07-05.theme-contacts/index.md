Close the distance between you.

This July is all about *contact*; the way people touch and are touched by their environment.

Last month's theme was [sensation][1], and while it was a fun and worthwhile endeavour I found myself wanted to bring my subjects closer together.
Instead of just seeing or hearing or feeling the nature around me, I wanted to *touch* it. 

I have a strange compulsion to touch my surroundings: to touch walls and railings and plants I'm walking past.
It doesn't make any real sense to me, but it feels good to lay my hands on the solid world and sample its textures.
That's the feeling I want to bring to this month's work.

Music today is [*Connaissais de Face*][2] by Khruangbin, which makes me feel like an old man sitting on a Parisian rooftop reminiscing about all the friends I've made and the promises I've broken.
