labourers destroy
the stump of my favourite tree

Sometimes you lose touch.

There's something to be said for letting go.
What used to be a good tree in a good place eventually became a dead tree in a good place, and after some soul searching I finally agreed that the rotting hunk of memories past was making the whole place a little less good.

I honestly don't know what they planted there to replace it, but I hope someone can love it as much as I loved its predecessor.

Today's music is *[Fairy Bread & Old Cartoons][1]* by Ivoris.
She's corny, she's cheesy, she's sometimes even cringey, but she makes me feel better than any artist ever has.
