```
resting on the oak
at the corner of fifth and main,
i feel the storm before she does.
```

Echoes in the earth.

The trees on those little traffic islands aren't just for throwing bottles at.
Sometimes when I'm crossing a certain street I just lean against the big tree in the traffic island and feel the vibrations of the earth reverberating through it.

This haiku also has some slight [Spelunky intro poem][2] vibes, which I enjoy.
There's definitely a place here for longer, more rambling haiku.

Music today is [*I Belong In Your Arms*][1] by Chairlift, a song that generates a very specific kind of happiness I often need.
