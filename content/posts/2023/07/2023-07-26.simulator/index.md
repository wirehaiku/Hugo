```
welcoming statues
in the unwelcoming grass â€”
an old place left to rot
```

Sometimes it goes away.

It doesn't happen often, but sometimes you find a place too late. A park, a cafe, a whole town; sometimes you find a beautiful place *after* it's lost its beauty, and all you can do is stare at the ruins and wonder.

Or sometimes you just find a beautiful place after it's been washed clean and rebuilt into something else. In Brisbane there's a famous pancake restaurant that's built into an old church, and every time I go there I stare at the ornate ceiling and wonder what came before.

In keeping with this micro-theme of loss, today's music is [*Here is Gone*][1] by the Goo Goo Dolls: a song about not quite knowing what you have and not quite wanting to find out.
