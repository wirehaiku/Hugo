Happy birthday to me!

To me surprise, it's been exactly a year (and two days) since my [first post][1] on Wire Haiku!
This is the first project of mine that's lasted this long, and the first that I've enjoyed this much.
(Perhaps those two things are connected.)

Thank you so much for reading Wire Haiku.
It's been a real treat writing these posts for you, and I hope to continue writing this blog for at least another year.
