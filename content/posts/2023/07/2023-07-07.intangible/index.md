a wayward finch
searching for warmth
finds an empty palm

Stay very still.

This was almost a haiku about children trying to touch the moon, until I remembered what [this month's theme][1] is supposed to be. 
Birdwatching — and birdcatching, to a lesser extent — were popular pastimes in my youth. 
(When you live in the middle of an inland forest, it's the closest thing to fishing you can get.)

I just remember the absolute *tension* of sitting perfectly still with a single nut or seed in my hand, furiously making eye contact with the bird I was trying to entice, as if I could telepathically persuade the creature to come closer. 

Oh, and today's song isn't just [the best Sugababes song][2], it's the best song of the nineties (despite the fact that it came out in 2000).
