Beginnings and endings.

Obviously it's the dead of winter in Australia, but a man can dream.
I just uncovered a huge archive of old haikus I wrote years ago, and they're almost all about summer: its birth, death and general goings on.
I wonder what kind of mood I was in to be so obsessed with such a thing.

(Actually I think I know: the last haiku project I attempted started with a burst of productivity in December, but died on the vine before I could even make it to autumn. Pity.)

Music today is multiple choice: would you like the original *Boys of Summer* by [Don Henley][1], the electronic cover by [DJ Sammy][2], or the alternative cover by [The Ataris][3]?
Personally I'd choose The Ataris, since that version has some much-needed aggression to it.
The titular boys of summer sound like jerks.
