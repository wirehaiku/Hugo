five minutes early

I see you shiver with...

Rocky Horror references aside, I like the excitement that comes with being early for something.
Even if it's something as small as being a little too early for the grocery store or being the first museum visitor of the day, I enjoy anticipation in all its forms.

Also, we obviously don't get a lot of snow up in [Queensland][1] but snow has a certain emotional weight to it, a certain sensory *something* it adds to its surroundings.
It's just one more paint on the infinite palette of the English language.

Today's music is the absolute tonal opposite of today's haiku.
*[Sun In Our Eyes][2]* by MØ and Diplo makes me long for summer, crave it, despair for it; even thought I know that I'll be longing for winter again the moments things heat up.
