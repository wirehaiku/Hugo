```
a hasty galah
lands flawlessly
on a broken bough

I saw this happen from my bedroom window not a moment ago.
A beautiful [sulphur-crested cockatoo][1] came in hot and landed on a tree branch that had already broken and had the fright of its life as it tried to land on a falling object.
Hilarious.
