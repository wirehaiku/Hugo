```
streetlit rainstorm
on a pure black sky —
film grain
```

The night becomes a canvas.

It's raining in my hometown — finally — and I'm enjoying the change in scenery.
The clouds have turned the whole sky a clean shade of purple-black and the streetlamps edge-light the rain.

On nights like this, the whole sky disappears and the foreground elements take on a life of their own.
Light, rain, neon, glass, reflections and refractions; they all blend freely into a brand new palette.
