lone butterfly 
on the dewy lapel
of a statue man

Any lapel in a storm.

Butterflies are this odd little omen; whenever one decides to roost near me I'm fascinated by its choices.
Why this park bench? Why that flower? Why chase me down the street and follow me into the coffee shop? 
It's always a fun little brush with divine chance.
