This month is all about the special little guys.

Last month we explored the theme of [‹layers›][1]: how different elements of a haiku can be combined together into a greater whole. 
I found it to be a mostly entertaining exercise, although there were a couple times where I got desperate and slapped a hasty background into a foreground haiku.

This month is all about the elements that are *too* different to be combined: the stragglers, the outliers, the diamonds in the rough.
Really it's an extension of the layers concept, where one layer is emphasised above the others (or all but one layer is de-emphasised).
Should be fun!
