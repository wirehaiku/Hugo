```
from a certain angle
i see nothing but the park —
cornered oasis

One angle among many.

In a city such as mine — a city built on rivers and coastline — there are a lot of opportunities for perspective shifts like these.
If I pick a certain corner of a certain block and stand on my tiptoes, it almost looks like this park/restaurant/statue/whatever is on an island all its own, and not (as it actually is) dumped in the middle of an urban landscape, surrounded by screaming cars and bustling streets.

It's a fun puzzle, finding the perfect slice of loneliness among such chaos.
