```
frail ravens
caught between the moon
and the masonry

(Turns out my local [Corvidae][1] are actually [crows][2], but the haiku's already written.)

Sometimes you turn a corner and see a perfect shot framed before you, but the moment passes before you can break out the camera.
For me, I saw a a flock — or a murder, I suppose — of crows, backlit perfectly by the full moon and right between the tops of two sandstone buildings. 

I couldn't snap a picture, but haiku are essentially a form of literary photograph, so I was able to capture it in my own way.
