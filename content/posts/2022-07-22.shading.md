Sometimes I have an idea.
A small, simple, slightly stupid idea, but an idea nonetheless, and I have to just get it out of my head and onto the page as soon as humanly possible.

Usually it's some tiny piece of wordplay that haunts me endlessly, like this one has for days. Fortunately, when you post every day you can afford to take chances.
