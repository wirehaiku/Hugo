In the summertime, my hometown is crowded with all manner of birds, screaming and laughing and cackling as they crowd the skies.
Obviously, wintertime holds a different story.

It is a little sad to see the city's treetops so still and devoid of life, but knowing they'll all be back soon enough keeps me going until then.
