```
within the forest
these deafening cicadas
become a sort of silence
```

My parents live in the middle of nowhere; a tiny homestead and horse paddock ringed by endless forest.
Despite my addiction to city life I still find it peaceful, the way the sounds of the forest wash out everything else.

It's deafening, but totally silent at the same time.
