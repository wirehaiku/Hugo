```
kookaburras
somehow laugh faster
in the cold
```

Consider this a sequel to [Rainbows in Grey][1] and another lament about the suffering of birds in the wintertime. 
My city is always full of cackling [kookaburras][2], but in the colder months their laughter becomes brittle, and you can almost feel the chills in their voices. 
Fortunately the cold seems to be easing up, so I can't wait until they're screaming at full force again.
