```
trespassing tempests â€”
crows and kookaburras
share the largest tree
```

It's that time of year again, when spring evicts winter in a gust of blazing wind.
I sympathise with all the birds at the back of my house; having to share their cramped homes
with each other as they wait out the storms.

The smaller ones seem okay with it, but the crows and kookaburras are beyond restless.
