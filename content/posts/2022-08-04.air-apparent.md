```
clouds rise like the sea:
waves crashing and roiling
on the shores of our horizon
```

I like a good metaphor.
I especially like metaphors that mix water and air, since the two act so much alike.
Clouds can drown, waves can float; there's so much shared imagery in the two.

(I also like a good title joke, if you haven't noticed already.)
