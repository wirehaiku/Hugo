rebar and red tape
around the thinnest whisper
of a newborn willow

I like seeing the little battlements people erect for new plants.
It's almost adorable, the sight of a wispy baby tree roped off behind towering walls.

Music today is [*Back on 74*][1] by Jungle, a song — and video — I've been compulsively watching for weeks.
The best music videos are always mesmerising.
