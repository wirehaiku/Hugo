```
across the bannered fence,
the gardens make their promise.
a sapling hugs the bars.
```

Patience, children.

My city of Brisbane is — like most cities — currently full of construction. Everywhere you turn there are banners and posters and print-outs promising the city of tomorrow.
Sometimes if you're lucky, you can get a peek past the banners and see what's being planned, although usually it's a giant pit of dirt and not an adorable little sapling.

Today's song is the audio equivalent of a triple-shot espresso and a slap in the face.
It's [*Ready to Go*][1] by Republica.
