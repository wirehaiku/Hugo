Hello, and welcome back to Wire Haiku.
I've redesigned the site (again) and I'm ready to get back into the swing of things after a nice long break.

For this month, the theme is [upkeep][1]: haiku about the continuance and perseverance of nature.
The idea came to me after waking up to a cold grey fog in the middle of an otherwise blazing-hot January:
I looked out at the milky, desaturated landscape and wondered how much effort is actually required to keep it all going.

Thank you so much for visiting Wire Haiku.
If you're new here, I write new posts every Monday, Wednesday and Friday; each including a haiku, a little blurb or diary entry and a relevant song that's been on my mind lately.
Read the [about page][2] if you haven't, and enjoy [today's banger][3].
