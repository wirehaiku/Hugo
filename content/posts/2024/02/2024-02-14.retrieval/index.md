For reasons I can't quite describe, I've been listening to [The Chicks][1] sixth album [*Home*][2] on repeat.
There's a lot to unpack in it, but more than anything the music is about finding someone special, building a home with them and — most importantly — coming back to it whenever you're needed.

Maybe that's cheesy, but it's always worked for me.
