Why yes, I have been binging Survivor.

There was a particular moment in *Survivor: Pearl Islands* when I realised the desert island had turned into a forest.
You'd think it would be an easy border to see — especially from above with the gratuitous helicopter footage — but down on the surface, the lines blur together in fascinating ways.

Today's music is ***not*** *Blurred Lines*, but something with a little more thematic relevance: [*Fader*][1] by The Temper Trap.
It's astounding how these guys came out of nowhere and established two eternal bangers in their very first album.
