all the simple wishes
we wrote in the sand
vanish in our rearview

Wash it all away.

Sand on the beach is plenty ephemeral by itself, but sand you have to leave behind is even more so.
I remember as a child spending hours building sandcastles and feeling strangely betrayed as I had to pack up my things and walk away, leaving all my good work for the other kids (and the ocean) to destroy.

Speaking of sandcastles, [*Sandcastles*][1] by Cable Ties is today's song.
It's an acquired taste, but I absolutely love "you're a jerk and I hate you" songs.
