Background and foreground as one.

Welcome to February, the most disturbing of months (because you're always so shocked it's not December anymore).
This month is all about [collisions][1]: that moment when the background smashes into the foreground and becomes something else entirely. 

I wish I could say this was inspired by some majestic vision of nature, but really it was inspired by a random shot in *Mr. Robot* where a blurry circle swoops out of the bokeh and turns back into a pigeon. (*Mr. Robot* rules, by the way.)

Music today is equally smashy: it's [*The Wreckoning*][2] by Boomkat: basically Avril Lavigne's angrier older sister.
