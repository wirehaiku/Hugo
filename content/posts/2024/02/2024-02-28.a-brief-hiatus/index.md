Just a quick announcement: Wire Haiku is going on hiatus until April!

<!--more-->

Somehow the planets have aligned and *every single important thing* I have to do this year is in March — weddings, festivals, dental appointments, you name it — so I won't have time to post regularly for the next few weeks.

So sorry for the interruption, but I'll see you guys on Monday April 1st 2024 for more Wire Haiku!
