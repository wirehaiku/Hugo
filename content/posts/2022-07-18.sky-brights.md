```
rivers shed rainbows
as our clouds fade to blue â€”
casino lights
```

In my city there's a [casino][1] that likes to blast enormous rainbow lights across the river and into the sky, so sometimes you'll turn a corner and see something that makes you question your eyes, like a bright red tree or a shimmering green river.

It's a fascinating effect, and it helps to give the city a little more colour during the winter months.
