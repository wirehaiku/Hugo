```
cherry blossoms fall,
we forgive ourselves
and take our pictures
```

After a litany of winter poems, I thought I'd look ahead to the future.
Every spring, dozens of cherry blossom trees in my neighbourhood come to life and shower the whole street in bright pink flowers. 

Whenever I see them I feel like a tourist in my own town, gleefully taking pictures and pointing them out to people.
It feels a little corny in the moment, but sometimes corny is a good thing.
