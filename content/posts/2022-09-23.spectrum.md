```
spears of grass
both faded and fresh
paint my palette

I'm an avid fan of [The Poetry Magazine Podcast][1] and there was a [recent episode][2] with Beth Piatote discussing the unique aspects of the Navajo language, specifically the Navajo's approach to describing nature.
In that episode, the specific phrase "spears of grass" caught my ear and I thought I'd use it.
