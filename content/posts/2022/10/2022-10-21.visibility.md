```
in the distant rain
city lights almost twinkle
like the stars we can't see
```

So it's been raining a lot, and that rain has been doing some interesting things to my view.
[Last time][1] the clouds were blocking my view of the sun, but now they're blocking the stars and I'm having to settle for the scraps of light I can get from the city's skyline.

Today's song is [Cotton Spheres][2] by Lama House, a gorgeous instrumental piece I stumbled upon moments before writing this.

(And yes, I broke [the rules][3] with the last line, but it was totally worth it.)
