```
tomorrow's rain clouds
drift lazily across our
blackened midnight sky

This one has a little too much padding, but I really wanted to describe the imagery I've been seeing out my window recently.
Enormous black rain clouds just sitting and waiting for the morning to come; just hovering out of reach.
