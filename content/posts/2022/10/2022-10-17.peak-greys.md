```
long clouds from the west:
fog swallows the mountaintops
and it starts to pour
```

I found a first draft of this in my archives, so I thought I'd sneak it in before summer truly takes over.

Rain clouds are probably the element of nature I most observe; the way they roll in and take over the sky; the way they shift shapes and colours over time.
Sometimes these clouds comes in great black walls that blot out the sun; sometimes they spill and splash over the landscape and sneak right up on you.

Oh, and I thought it'd be a nice idea to share the music I'm listening to as I write these. Today it was [Domino][1] by Amtrac, a song in the emerging genre of "gentle electronic panic attack"-core.
