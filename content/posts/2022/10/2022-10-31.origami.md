And so ends [‹basics›][1], **Wire Haiku**'s very first theme month.
It was fun to go all the way back to the essential rules of haiku — syllables, seasons and separation — but there were a few moments that I did feel constrained or used the rules as a crutch to get things done.

Now that basic training is over, it'll be nice to get a little wild and start experimenting again; to mess around and make things that don't exactly fit into the neat spaces we've been carving here.
(It'll also be nice to stop counting syllables.)

I hope you enjoyed this first themed month of **Wire Haiku**, and I hope the next one is even better.
I'm not sure what it is yet, but it'll definitely be a little more open and a lot less rules-based.
See you then!
