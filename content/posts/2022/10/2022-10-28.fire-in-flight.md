spirals in the dark:
fireflies chases their tails

Summer has almost arrived and the bugs along with it.
I don't really want to see any insects in my own home, but I do enjoy seeing them dance and dally at the edges of our yard.

(Honestly I'm more worried about the eventual return of the spiders, but that's at least another few weeks away.)
