```
harp strings on rooftops —
sounds from a distant party
crash on my curtains
```

Okay, so there's *technically* not any seasonal reference in this haiku — a clear violation of [my own rules][1] — but this was too nice to not post.
I've been listening to a lot of [Emily Hopkins][2] and fuzzy harp music has completely infected my brain.
