```
the papery line
between rooftops and rain clouds:
tomorrow's promise
```

My city is moments away from a solid month of rain, and the clouds are slowly marching forward.
I'm excited for the rain, but I do miss seeing the sky.

Oh, and today's song is [Star Without a Sky][1], by the amazing vern matz.
