palm fronds touch black glass â€”

It's always an odd feeling when I see fresh plants in an office environment.
On the one hand I'm glad it's there, but on the other it does feel weird to take a such a wild thing and cram it into such a small box.

I have no problem putting an oak tree on main street, but planting a forest in a hallway closet doesn't seem like that great a move.
