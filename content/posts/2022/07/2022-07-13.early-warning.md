```
the smell of rain
moments before
the sound of it
```

This haiku is so ludicrously simple it barely counts, but I wrote it years ago and still think about it.

It's such a beautiful moment for me, when I walk past a window and smell the rain coming from a mile away.
Most times I just stop what I'm doing and wait for it to wash over me; watch the clouds get darker and lighter.
