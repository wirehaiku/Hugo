It's Christmas time, which means Christmas stuff is absolutely everywhere, including places it probably shouldn't be.
Growing up in the country, I remember seeing a koala clawing at a party balloon stuck in a tree and just feeling *so* guilty about it; seeing this poor creature dealing with *our* garbage.

While you're enjoying yourselves this Christmas, please be sure to clean up after yourselves and keep the wilderness as clean as you found it.
