summary: "The best songs I've heard in 2022!"
---

After [books][1] comes music.
I heard a lot of amazing music this year, so here in no particular order are the best songs I discovered in 2022.
(Again, they don't have to be songs that *came out* this year, just ones I first heard in 2022.)

### *[After Dark][2]* by Mr. Kitty

The most authentic representation of young love.
When I listen to this, I feel nostalgic for that strange teenage time when I'd fall in love with every person who paid attention to me, when I'd go on a first date and spend my nights dreaming of the second.
And of course, I adore the deep, dark eighties synthesiser melodies.
Instant classic.

### *[Tieduprightnow][3]* by Parcels

From the eighties to the seventies, Parcels are taking the weird jangly softrock my grandparents listened to and turning it into smooth, experiential indie pop that always soothes my soul.

### *[black blue BOO][4]* by Isaac Thursday

Let's take a hard right turn into the future.
[Breakcore][5] is by far the genre I listened to the most this year.
It's fast, it's chaotic, but it always makes sense and it always sounds amazing.
I like to just listen to it with my eyes closed and try to pick apart all the little rhythms in my mind.

### *[we fell in love in october][6]* by girl in red

My *second*-most listened to genre this year is slow, soulful, painful indie love songs.
At first I was listening to the [Heartstopper][7] soundtrack on repeat, but I eventually branched out and ended up listening to girl in red's entire discography in one quiet, rainy night.
What an experience.

### *[Heavy Hearted][8]* by The Jungle Giants

Finally, no list of my favourite music would be complete without a major club *banger*.
This is the stuff I blast when it's two in the morning and I need to write a damn blog post right *now*.
Also, the music video is absolutely hypnotising.

So, those are some of my favourite songs this year.
Thanks for reading, and I'll see you next time for another retrospective!
