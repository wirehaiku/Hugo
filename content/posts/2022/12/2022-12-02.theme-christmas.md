It's Christmas, and with that comes our **[Christmas][1]** theme.
A celebration of the yuletide season in the classic Australian style: blue skies, shrimp and sunburn.
Our country has spent the last two hundred years translating this freezing European ritual into a sun-soaked pool party and we're getting pretty good at it.

But first, some housekeeping.
After one more week of original haiku I'll be writing some best-of-the-year posts and retrospectives to wrap things up, then going on a two-week hiatus from December 24 to January 7.
Then I'll be back in full swing with a new theme and new haiku for 2023.

I'll also be setting up a Patreon in the near future and posting some regular bonus content, so please be on the lookout for that!
You can keep up with the site by following me on Mastodon at [@stvmln@stvmln.com][2] or subscribing to the [RSS feed][3].

Thank you so much for reading **Wire Haiku**; I'm incredibly grateful to have a place to share my art and a community to share it with.
It's always a pleasure to write for you.
