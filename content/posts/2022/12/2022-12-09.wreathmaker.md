two coyish wrens
eye the wreathmaker's basket

There we have it, the last haiku of 2022.
White flowers are starting to bloom in the trees surrounding my home, so I had a random thought of making a Christmas wreath out of local flowers and vines instead of the traditional materials.

The next two weeks will be best-of retrospective posts, then it's a short hiatus until January 7.
Thank you so much for reading **Wire Haiku** this year, it was a pleasure to write for you.
