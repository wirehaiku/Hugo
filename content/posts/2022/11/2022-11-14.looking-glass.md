two kingfishers
in the sudden street light
dive for water

First of all, let me say hello to my new friends on [Mastodon][1]!
I've started my own instance at [stvmln.com][2] and spent the weekend digging into all the different communities and making friends with the wonderful people there.

I think street lights are going to be a common sight in this month's theme, because they're so poetically malleable.
Little islands of light that flicker on and off; it's a complete change of scenery in the blink of an eye.

I also love the Australian theme of having beautiful animals you'd normally find in the wilderness just hanging out in the city; because most Australian cities are just encampments in the wilderness.
