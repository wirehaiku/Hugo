lightning
strikes
everywhere the rain isn't

I don't know if this is factually true, but it's certainly emotionally true.
It's storm season in my hometown, and at night I feel like I can see two great forces descend on the city: a blanket of rain and a volley of lightning, both carving their own paths across the horizon.
