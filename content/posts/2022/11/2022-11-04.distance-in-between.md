```
two frail moths
lost in the lonely space
between street lights

A sequel of sorts to [Fire in Flight][1]; as the heat rises, so do the insects.
Walking home, I found that every street light was providing refuge to a tiny crowd of bugs, some dancing through the light like a children through a sprinkler and some simply clinging to the glass for dear life.
