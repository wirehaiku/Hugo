```
amber and sapphire â€”
sunset lazily marbles
into night
```

I love a chaotic sunset; one that just riddles the sky with ridiculous patterns.
Neon pinks and blues streaking across the dimming background, backlit clouds splashing around on top of them.
I love when nature decides to have fun with itself.
