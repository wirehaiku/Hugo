Hello and welcome to the next themed month of **Wire Haiku**.
Last month's theme was **[Basics][1]**: establishing the core of haiku and helping me establish some semblance of structure in my work.
Now that I've done that, I think it's time to have some fun with and get a little weirdness in the mix.

For the month of November 2022, our theme is **[Nights][2]**: haiku all about moonlight, lamplight, quiet streets, screaming cicadas; all the wonderful little things that happen in a city when the sun goes down.

I'm not going to lie, this theme is mostly inspired by the amazing show *[What We Do in the Shadows][3]* and my obsession with it, but I also just really enjoy the night as a context to play around in.
It has so much built-in material to work with, I just can't wait.

So, that's the theme for this month. Thank you so much for reading **Wire Haiku**, and I hope you enjoy what's to come.
