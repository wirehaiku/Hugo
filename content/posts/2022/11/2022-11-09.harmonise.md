```
midnight in the square
and every single beetle
is screaming
```

This haiku is supposed to be positive, but I suppose it depends when you're reading it.
It's fun to hear the beetles sing when it's the first or the last night of summer, but there's a moment in the middle when it's almost a torment; when all the chittering bounces off the street and right into your ears.
