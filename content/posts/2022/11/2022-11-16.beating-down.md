I'm leaning into a more naturalistic form of haiku, one that feels less like a construction of [rules][1] and more like a quote or a saying, captured from an invisible author.
A haiku is a snapshot of a specific moment in time so I like to think this current batch of haiku are snapshots of reactions to those moments.

Also, if you're reading this you should probably also read the works of [Clem Byard][2]. They write excellent haiku and [haibun][3] about Australian culture and scenery, so be sure to check them out!
