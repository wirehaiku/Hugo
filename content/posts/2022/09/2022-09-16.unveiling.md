```
first notes of spring:
ten red flowers,
twelve feet up
```

There are a number of flowering trees on my street.
While it's always nice to see them blooming in the spring, my favourite moment is the first bloom, when the red buds slowly begin to open and reveal themselves to the waiting world.

(Oh, and my second-favourite moment is peak bloom, when every tree on the street is at its brightest and there are so many flowers on the ground you can't see the grass.)
