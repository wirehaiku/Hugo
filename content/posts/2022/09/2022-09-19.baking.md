```
scrapers catch the sun
and throw it into the streets â€”
blast furnace
```

It feels nice to finally walk through the city streets and not shiver, not instinctively reach for a jumper I'm not wearing.
Summer isn't quite here yet, but I can feel its presence more and more each day.

(Catch me in six months feeling the same about winter.)
