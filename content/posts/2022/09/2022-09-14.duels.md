```
a battle of warmth
plays out on the bitter streets
as spring evicts winter
```

I wrote yesterday about the [changing of the seasons][1] and how much I enjoy it, and part of that enjoyment is watching each season replace the last.
Walking through my city and feeling the newfound warmth heat my heart; it's such a delight to feel spring slowly come into being all around me.
