```
alleyway coffee â€”
i step through the tabbycats
and find a soapbox in the sun
```

I have a fondness for weird little businesses in weird little places; whether it's an internet cafe in a hotel basement or a coffeeshop in a parking lot alleyway.
There's something about exploring a small space and finding your own little home within it (a home with several cats that don't belong to you).
