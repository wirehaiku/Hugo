reaching into sun,
the neighbour's cat lengthens
and contracts.

Welcome to the first ever post for Wire Haiku. I always see my neighbour's cat sunning itself on the windowsill, moving so slowly as it tries to keep up with the shifting sunlight.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy Wire Haiku.
