Hello and welcome to **Wire Haiku**, a journal of [haiku poetry][1] about city life and modern nature.
I'm Stephen Malone, and every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I write a new haiku and publish it here for you all to see.

I run my own Mastodon instance at [stvmln.com][2] and you can follow my work by:

- Following this website's feed at [@wirehaiku@stvmln.com][3],
- Following my personal feed at [@stvmln@stvmln.com][4], or
- Subscribing to the RSS feed at [wirehaiku.org/index.xml][5].

You can also support me by making a small donation at [ko-fi.com/wirehaiku][6], and get in touch by emailing [mail@wirehaiku.org][7].

Thanks for visiting **Wire Haiku**, I sincerely hope you enjoy it.
