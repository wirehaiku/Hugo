Hello and welcome to **Wire Haiku**, a journal of [haiku poetry][1] about city life and modern nature.
I'm Stephen Malone, and every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I write a new haiku and publish it here for you all to see.

If you'd like updates on my work, I run my own Mastodon instance at [stvmln.com][2] and you can follow my personal feed at [@stvmln][3].
You can also get the [RSS feed][4], if you're old-school like me.

Finally, if you enjoy my work you can support me by subscribing to my [Patreon][5]! 
There's weekly bonus content just for patrons, and you can vote on upcoming themes I'll be writing about. 
Of course, the regular content will always be free for everyone.

Thanks for visiting **Wire Haiku**, I sincerely hope you enjoy it. 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please send me a direct message at [@stvmln][3] or email [mail@wirehaiku.org][6].
