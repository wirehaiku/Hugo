Hello and welcome to **Wire Haiku**, a journal of [haiku poetry][1] about city life and modern nature.
I'm Stephen Malone, and every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I write a new haiku and publish it here for you all to see.

If you like my work, you can follow the [Twitter][2] account for updates, tell your friends about this site or even [send me a donation][3].
(Or just keep on reading, that's absolutely fine as well.)

Finally, if you have any questions or feedback you can reach me at [mail@wirehaiku.org][4], or send a direct message to the [Twitter][2] account.

Thanks for visiting **Wire Haiku**, I hope you enjoy it.
