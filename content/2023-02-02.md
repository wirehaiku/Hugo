Hello cacophony, my old friend.

<!--more-->

This month, I thought I'd experiment a little by moving past visuals and instead investigating the **[sounds][1]** of the city.
Recently, a lot of my haiku have been silent, sterile presentations of something I've seen but not heard, so it felt like a good idea to shift my senses and focus on sound for this month's theme.

Also, as I write this I'm listening to [Marc Rebillet, Eryka Badhu and Reggie Watts][2] make hip hop beats out of animal sounds, and it sent my mind spinning to this particular idea.)

```
battling thunderstorms
barely reach me
through stone walls
```

If I'm looking for specifics, I guess there are two main kinds of sound I'd like to spend this month writing about: the sounds we don't hear, and the sounds we forget hearing.
Like the way chirping crickets fading into the background, or how walking into a house erases the soundscape you just left.

```
crickets
destroy the silence
and create a new one
```

Sound is such a fun tool to play with and I'm surprised it took me this long to get my act together and play with it.

??? needs better send off ???
