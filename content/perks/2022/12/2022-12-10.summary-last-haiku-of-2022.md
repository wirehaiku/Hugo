This week, we wrapped up the **[christmas][1]** theme and I managed to write the last few ideas I had before the window closed completely.
I'm pretty happy about these last few haiku, but I'm also nervous about finding some eye-catching openers for next year.
Ah, the tension!

The next two weeks are going to be some best-of retrospectives where I go back and look at all the haiku I've written so far, and wax a little poetic about the year that's passed.
Stay tuned for that, and for the bonus tanka poem coming tomorrow!
