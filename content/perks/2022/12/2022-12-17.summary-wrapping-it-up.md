After five months of haiku writing, it's nice to change things up and write some genuine blog posts for a little bit.

This week, we wrapped up the **[christmas][1]** theme and I wrote some retrospectives about the year we all just went through.
It was certainly an interesting year, one where I spent a lot of time waiting anxiously to see if COVID was going to rear its ugly head again or if I could actually, finally, start spending quality time with people again.

It was also a year where I started writing haiku again!
At first it was a rather haphazard affair (at first I tried to write a haiku every day and just completely burned out for a couple weeks), but I eventually got a handle on things and did some work I'm actually kinda proud of.

Thank you so much for reading **Wire Haiku**, and for supporting this nutty thing I do.
