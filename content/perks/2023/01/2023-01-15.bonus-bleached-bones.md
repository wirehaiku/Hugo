```
winter, every stone
bears a nest, a web, a hive.

summer, the same stones —
sun-burned, rain-bleached, wind-brushed —
bear nothing.
```

In my mind, every spring is book-ended by two very different moments.

First is the end of winter, when all the little animals come out of hiding and start to build their homes anew.
Every nook and cranny is filled with life, every building on every street has a dozen little places for a creature to live.

Second is the start of summer, when the newborns are all born and the gentle breezes turn into burning storms.
All those little crevices full of life get flushed by the rains and burned by the sun, and all those little animals retreat into gardens and parks and places where they're actually welcome.

Of course the city is still teeming with life, but I do feel a little sad when I'm walking to work and see a nest missing or a cobweb snapped.
