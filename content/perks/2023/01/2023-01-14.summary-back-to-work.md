Well I had a fun little break, but it's time to get back into the swing of things and start writing haiku again.

**Posts for the week starting 8 January 2023:**

- [Theme: Brightness](https://wirehaiku.org/posts/2023/01/theme-brightness/) 9 January 2023
- [Glass Valley](https://wirehaiku.org/posts/2023/01/glass-valley/) 11 January 2023
- [Hushed](https://wirehaiku.org/posts/2023/01/hushed/) 13 January 2023

I'm already really enjoying the theme of "brightness", since (a) it's what I'm currently experiencing, and (b) it was surprisingly hard to write haiku about Christmas lights.
(Seriously, there are only so many ways to fit red and green lights into nature scenes.)

Tomorrow we'll have the first bonus post of the year, and then it's off to the races.
Hopefully this year is just as beautiful and inspiring as the last.

Thanks for reading **Wire Haiku**, and I'll see you next time.
