climb aboard the sun-warmed bell
of a fallen church

a kind-eyed gardener takes pity
and slowly pushes it outside

Like a lot of people, I have a yearly tradition where I like to get comfortable and watch the entirety of *Band of Brothers* in as close to one sitting as possible.
It's an amazing show for a lot of reasons, but this time around I found myself marvelling at the scenery.
Ruined churches, fallen cathedrals, all that brick and mortar and lead-lined glass just covering the already-broken ground.

We don't get a lot of that architecture over here in Australia — colonists learned pretty quickly to optimise for cooling, not heating — so I thought I'd take a trip outside my usual context and write a nice little tanka about the other side of the world.

Also, it's interesting to write about animals making use of things we've left behind, and how the objects we deem essential would be seen by other creatures.
To the geckos, a church is a good shelter and a bell is a fantastic heat-collector, but the uses we have for these objects are utterly lost on them.
