I read *The Hunt for Red October* and now my brain is full of fancy words.

One of my goals this year is to *drastically* increase the number of books I read.
I'm the classic high-school bookwork who read voraciously during my teenage years and then took a hard right turn into YouTube and videogames once I hit my twenties.
(To be fair, early YouTube was basically a full-blown [Riddler box][1].)

At first it was hard to change course, but my bookworm habits are slowly coming back to me.
For the first time in years I managed to spend a solid two hours simply reading, without getting itchy every five minutes and reaching for my phone (or the fridge).

Hopefully I can keep that up for the rest of the year.
Thanks for reading, and I'll see you tomorrow for the bonus tanka.
